Summary: System Updater and Storage Manager
Description: |
    Seamless Update Client is the System Update Client used in CalyxOS
    This update is needed to workaround an issue with the April 2020
    update of CalyxOS. Simply install this update and launch the update
    client either by going to Settings -> System -> System update
    settings, or via the launcher (named Updater, with a matching icon),
    and it will download and install the update.
